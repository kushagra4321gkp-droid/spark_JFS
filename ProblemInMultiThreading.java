// }  -> and i dry run it for both threads, since they are not synchronized, they are running concurrently, so suppose t3 ran for 3 times so it updates the sum variable 3 times and it's value becomes 3, the for 2 times i dry ran t4 for 2 times so again loop ran for 2, then add( ) was called 2 times and it updated the sum variable 2 times and then the value of sum becomes 6, the process continues, so this way it should calculate the answer correctly, so no need run the t3 for 1000 times alone then start t4 and run 1000 times and the sum becomes 2000. then why sometimes it calculates wrong answer?

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Excellent question 👏 — you’ve understood concurrency pretty well.
// Now let’s carefully go over why the answer sometimes comes out wrong even though it seems like both threads are “just adding 1 each time”.

// 🧠 The Hidden Problem: Race Condition

// You said:

// “t3 ran 3 times, sum became 3, then t4 ran 2 times, sum became 5... so final is correct.”

// That’s how it should work logically — if both threads were taking turns in order and every operation (sum += 1) was done atomically (as a single, indivisible step).
// But the key issue is — in Java,

// sum += 1;


// is not a single operation.

// ⚙️ What Actually Happens

// When you write sum += 1, the CPU (and JVM) break it down into 3 separate steps:

// Read the current value of sum from memory

// Add 1 to that value

// Write the new value back to memory

// ⚡ Now imagine this interleaving:

// Let’s say sum = 0 initially.

// Step	Thread	Operation	Value in Memory	Local (Thread copy)
// 1	t3	reads sum	0	0
// 2	t4	reads sum	0	0
// 3	t3	adds 1	0	1
// 4	t4	adds 1	0	1
// 5	t3	writes back 1	1	1
// 6	t4	writes back 1	1	1

// 👉 Both threads added 1, but the final sum is 1, not 2!
// Because t4 overwrote t3’s update — the operations collided.

// This is called a race condition.

// 🔒 How synchronized fixes it

// When you add:

// synchronized void add() {
//     sum += 1;
// }


// Java ensures that only one thread can run the add() method on the same Addition object at a time.

// Thread t3 locks the object → executes the whole method → releases lock.

// Then t4 can enter.

// So all 2000 operations (1000 + 1000) happen sequentially, giving a guaranteed correct result.

// 💡 Key takeaway

// Even though logically it feels like both threads are just “adding”, the CPU and memory system allow interleaving at instruction level, causing lost updates.

// That’s why multithreading bugs are so tricky — everything looks fine in small test runs, but fails randomly due to timing.

// 🧩 Optional Thought

// If you ever want a thread-safe counter without synchronized, you can use:

// import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

// AtomicInteger sum = new AtomicInteger(0);
// sum.incrementAndGet();


// ✅ Internally, it uses atomic CPU instructions — no locks, no race conditions.

// Would you like me to visualize this with a step-by-step diagram showing how the threads interleave and lose updates?

// You said:
// if these 3 separate steps would be the case and only one is there then what should happpen?
// ChatGPT said:

// Excellent follow-up — that’s exactly the kind of “dig deeper” thinking that separates average programmers from real Java developers. 👏

// Let’s unpack your question carefully:

// if these 3 separate steps (read → add → write) would be the case and only one is there then what should happen?

// 🧠 The scenario you’re imagining

// You’re asking:

// “What if the whole sum += 1 acted as one single atomic step — i.e., it couldn’t be interrupted by another thread?”

// Then this is what would happen 👇

// ⚙️ Case 1 — Non-Atomic (Normal)

// sum += 1 breaks down into:
// 1️⃣ read sum
// 2️⃣ add 1
// 3️⃣ write back

// So if two threads run concurrently:

// Step	Thread	Action	Memory sum	Local
// 1	t3	read 0	0	0
// 2	t4	read 0	0	0
// 3	t3	add 1	0	1
// 4	t4	add 1	0	1
// 5	t3	write 1	1	1
// 6	t4	write 1	1	1

// 👉 Final sum = 1, even though 2 threads incremented.
// That’s the race condition problem we saw.

// ⚡ Case 2 — Atomic (Single Step)

// Now suppose the JVM/CPU could do this in one indivisible operation, something like:

// atomic sum = sum + 1;


// Then, even if both threads tried to update sum at the same time, the CPU would handle them one by one internally — like this:

// Step	Thread	Action	Memory sum	Result
// 1	t3	atomic add 1	0 → 1	sum = 1
// 2	t4	atomic add 1	1 → 2	sum = 2

// ✅ No lost update. Always correct.

// So the final answer would always be 2000 in your code.

// 💡 Why Java’s int doesn’t behave atomically

// Because:

// int is a normal variable in main memory (not special hardware counter).

// The JVM allows threads to read and write independently — it doesn’t lock each CPU instruction.

// The smallest “atomic” unit for Java’s memory model is usually a single 32-bit read or write, not a read-modify-write combination.

// So sum++ looks small, but it’s three JVM bytecode instructions, not one.

// ✅ How to make it atomic

// You have two main choices:

// 1️⃣ Use synchronized (adds a lock)
// synchronized void add() {
//     sum += 1;
// }


// Slower, but guarantees only one thread modifies sum at a time.

// 2️⃣ Use AtomicInteger (lock-free)
// import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

// AtomicInteger sum = new AtomicInteger(0);
// sum.incrementAndGet(); // atomic operation


// Internally uses special CPU instructions like compare-and-swap (CAS) — single atomic step.

// 🧩 Summary Table
// Type	Steps	Thread Safety	Speed
// int sum += 1	3 (read, add, write)	❌ Not safe	✅ Fast
// synchronized add()	Atomic (via lock)	✅ Safe	⚠️ Slower
// AtomicInteger.incrementAndGet()	Atomic (CAS)	✅ Safe	✅ Fast (no lock)

// Would you like me to show you how AtomicInteger actually works internally (using CAS) with a short visual example? It’s one of the coolest things in Java concurrency.
